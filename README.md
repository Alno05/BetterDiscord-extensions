### [Toggle Sections](https://github.com/kettui/BetterDiscord-extensions/blob/master/plugins/ToggleSections/ToggleSections.plugin.js)
Allows you to hide sections of the program (server, channel, ~~user list~~ no need for it anymore)

- Settings include choosing the button color and the option to choose which buttons are displayed. Buttons can also be disabled individually, or hidden altogether in favor keyboard shotcuts (below).
- *Since v1.5:* Keyboard hotkeys included by default: ```Ctrl+Shift+X``` toggles guilds, ```Ctrl+Shift+C``` toggles channels; configurable since v1.6 thanks to @DacioRomero
